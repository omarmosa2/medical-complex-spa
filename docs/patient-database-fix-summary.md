# Patient Database Schema Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was throwing a `Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'name' in 'field list'` error when trying to create a new patient. The error occurred because there was a mismatch between the database schema and the application code.

## Root Cause
1. **Migration Applied**: A migration (`2025_10_27_094500_update_patients_table_for_new_fields.php`) had been applied that updated the patients table schema:
   - Removed old columns: `name`, `file_number`, `date_of_birth`
   - Added new columns: `full_name`, `age`
   - Updated phone column to be nullable
   - Renamed `address` to `residence`

2. **Model Conflicts**: The Patient model had conflicting accessors and mutators that were still trying to use the old `name` field
3. **Validation Mismatch**: The validation rules were expecting fields that didn't match the new database schema
4. **Controller Issues**: The controller methods were using outdated field names

## Files Modified

### 1. `app/Models/Patient.php`
- **Before**: Had conflicting `getFullNameAttribute()` that returned `$this->name` and `setNameAttribute()`/`setFullNameAttribute()` methods
- **After**: Simplified to properly handle `full_name` as the actual database field
- **Changes**: 
  - Removed name-related accessors/mutators
  - Simplified `getFullNameAttribute()` to return `$this->attributes['full_name']`
  - Simplified `setFullNameAttribute()` to set `$this->attributes['full_name']`

### 2. `app/Http/Requests/StorePatientRequest.php`
- **Before**: Validated `age` with `min:1`
- **After**: Updated validation to `min:0` (for newborns)
- **Added**: Better error handling and custom attributes for validation messages

### 3. `app/Http/Requests/UpdatePatientRequest.php`
- **Before**: Validated `age` with `min:1`
- **After**: Updated validation to `min:0`
- **Added**: Custom attributes for validation messages

### 4. `app/Http/Controllers/PatientController.php`
- **Before**: `getPatientData()` method was trying to access `date_of_birth` and `name` fields
- **After**: Updated to use correct fields: `full_name`, `age`, `residence`
- **Added**: Error handling in the `store()` method
- **Changes**:
  - Fixed `getPatientData()` to return correct field names
  - Added try-catch in `store()` method
  - Added success/error flash messages

## Database Schema (After Migration)
```sql
CREATE TABLE patients (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('male', 'female') NOT NULL,
    age INT NULL,
    residence TEXT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(255) NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NULL UNIQUE,
    notes TEXT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Expected Request Data Format
```json
{
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "gender": "male", 
    "age": 30,
    "residence": "123 Main St, City",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "notes": "Optional notes"
}
```

## Testing
After these changes, patient creation should work correctly. The system will:
1. Validate incoming data against the new field requirements
2. Create the patient record with the correct field mappings
3. Log the activity with the correct patient name reference

## Notes
- The age field now allows 0 (for newborns)
- Phone and email are now nullable fields
- The migration should be run if it hasn't been already: `php artisan migrate`
- All frontend forms should now use the new field names (`full_name`, `residence` instead of `name`, `address`)
